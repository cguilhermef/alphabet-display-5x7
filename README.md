# alphabet-display-5x7

Simple code to render alphabet uppercase letters in a 5x7 led display, with two 74hc595 driver controling columns and rows.
This project was builded on [Timo Denk](https://github.com/Simsso/ShiftRegister74HC595) ShfitRegister library. 

Display used is FYM-7571Bx. Pinout can found [here](http://files.rct.ru/pdf/indicator/fym-7571ax_bx.pdf)

I build this project just for fun  = )
